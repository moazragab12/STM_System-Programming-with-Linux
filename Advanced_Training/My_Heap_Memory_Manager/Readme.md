# Custom Memory Allocator

Custom Memory Allocator is a simple memory allocation library written in C, providing custom implementations of `malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, and `realloc` functions.

## Features

- Implements memory allocation functions (`malloc`, `free`, `calloc`, `realloc`) using a custom memory allocation strategy.
- Designed to manage memory allocation more efficiently in specific use cases.

## Usage

To use the custom memory allocator in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
 ```
   git clone [https://github.com/username/custom-memory-allocator.git](https://github.com/moazragab12/STM_System-Programming-with-Linux.git)
```
2-  Include the hmm.h header file in your project.

3- Compile your project along with the custom memory allocator source files.

4- Utilize the custom memory allocation functions (malloc, free, calloc, realloc) as needed in your code.
