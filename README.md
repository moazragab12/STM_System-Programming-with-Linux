# STM_System-Programming-with-Linux

Welcome to my System Programming Tasks Repository! Here, you'll find a collection of tasks I've completed, focusing on system programming under Linux. Throughout this repository, I've utilized system calls and developed a Pico shell capable of executing both built-in and external commands efficiently and simple harddisk reader that prints information about partitions.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Intro to System Programming Training

I've successfully completed the "Intro to System Programming under Linux" training at STMicroelectronics. The training encompassed a variety of topics, including:
- Linux History
- Command line usage and Build Process
- Process Management
- User Management
- Filesystem Management

### 2. Pico Shell Development

One of the standout projects I've worked on is the development of a Pico shell. Here's what it can do:
- Execute built-in commands such as `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, etc.
- Handle external commands by utilizing system calls for process management, I/O redirection, and command execution.
- Provide a basic yet functional terminal interface, replicating essential shell functionalities.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `FinalShell/`: Contains the source code for the Pico shell implementation .
- `docs/`: Documentation and resources related to the project.
- `tasks/`: Various tasks completed during the training period.

## Getting Started

To explore the code and functionalities:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `FinalShell/` directory.
3. Compile the Pico shell source code using your preferred compiler.
4. Run the compiled binary to start using the Pico shell.
